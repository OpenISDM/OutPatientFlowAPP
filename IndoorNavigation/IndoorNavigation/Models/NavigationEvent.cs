 * File Description:
 *
 *      This file contains all the interfaces required by the application,
 *      such as the interface of IPSClient and the interface for 
 *      both iOS project and the Android project to allow the Xamarin.Forms 
 *      app to access the APIs on each platform.
 *      
 * Version:
 *
 *      1.0.0, 20190605

 * File Name:
 *
 *      NavigationEvent.cs
 *
 * Abstract:
 *
 *      Waypoint-based navigator is a mobile Bluetooth navigation application
 *      that runs on smart phones. It is structed to support anywhere 
 *      navigation indoors in areas covered by different indoor positioning 
 *      system (IPS) and outdoors covered by GPS.In particilar, it can rely on
 *      BeDIS (Building/environment Data and Information System) for indoor 
 *      positioning. This IPS provides a location beacon at every waypoint. The 
 *      beacon brocasts its own coordinates; Consequesntly, the navigator does 
 *      not need to continuously monitor its own position.
 *      This version makes use of Xamarin.Forms, which is a cross-platform UI 
 *      tookit that runs on both iOS and Android.
