	Todo:
		1. About connection in a region
			- when the distance between current waypoint and next waypoint is lower than a value, we decide to ignore it
				# maybe the value is not a constant, it can change with the mobile RSSI?
			- We have to consider the direction, because we will not ignore a turning point.

		2. About connection between region and region
			- Consider the distance between source and portal type waypoint first.
			- if the distances of all possible edges have no highest value, then consider the priority of the type.
				Generally, the priority should be : Hallway(?) > escalator > elevator > stair
